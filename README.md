# Shortify

Shortify is a simple front-end project that demonstrates how a URL shortener works.  
It takes a long link from the user, generates a random short code, and displays a fake shortened link.  
This project is made for learning purposes and **does not** actually shorten URLs using a backend or real API.

## âœ¨ Features
- Enter any long link in the input box.
- Generate a fake short link with just one click.
- Copy the fake link to your clipboard.
- Simple, clean, and responsive design.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **HTML** â€“ Structure of the page.
- **CSS** â€“ Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** â€“ Logic for generating fake short links and copying them.

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. User enters a long URL in the input field.
2. JavaScript generates a random short code.
3. The short link is shown to the user (example: `https://saint69.ly/2jtxtk`).
4. User can copy it using the "Copy" button.

âš  **Note:**  
This project does **not** connect to a real URL shortening service.  
The short links will **not** redirect to the original site. This is only for demonstration and learning purposes.
